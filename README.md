# notes

This is a collection of notes I've taken. Only the ones since 2024 are here, since I've lost access
to most of the old ones. Note that many of what I do will be under `/private`, which is a gitignored
directory, so it won't be here. You are free to use issues to ask questions about anything I've
written, although this repository is more of a storage than anything else.
