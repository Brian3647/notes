# notes

This is a collection of notes I've taken. Only the ones since 2024 are here, since I've lost access
to most of the old ones. Note that many of what I do will be under `/private`, which is a gitignored
directory, so it won't be here. You are free to use issues to ask questions about anything I've
written, although this repository is more of a storage than anything else.

notes might be in any language, or a mix of them. since english is an extremelly simple language, i write most of the notes in it, but since i'm catalan, some concepts might be expressed in spanish or catalan. acronyms might also not reference english words.
