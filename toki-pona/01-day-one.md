# day 1

since i did this before starting this repo, i'll just leave the quick concepts i want to remember

## quick concepts

- mi, sina, ona, ni: check [vocab.md](./vocab.md)
- basic sentence: `<SUBJECT> li* <VERB> [e <OBJECT / CD>]`
  - \*li marks verbs
  - \*li not used when subject is mi or sina
  - `e` marks CD (direct object)
- nouns/adjectives can usually be used as verbs
- using something as a verb can also mean 'is' (e.g. 'mi jan' = 'i am a person')
- imperative marked with `o`:
  - `o moku` = 'eat!'
  - `o lukin e mi` = 'look at me!'
  - `jan Andi o` = 'Andi!'
  - `jan Andi o moku` = 'Andi, eat!'
  - `jan Andi o lukin e mi` = 'Andi, look at me!'
- `ala` is negation
  - `mi moku ala` = 'i don't eat'
