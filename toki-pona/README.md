# toki pona

toki! here i'll write my process of learning toki pona. for me, the best way to learn
a language is act like if i'm teaching it to someone else, so most of the content here
is like a tutorial that is wrong and steadily gets better. i'll also write about my
thoughts on the language and how i'm using it. most of the learning is thanks to
