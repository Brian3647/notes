## `pi` can be used as 'of'

in toki pona, when using multiple nouns together you can read it as `(A of B) of C`. You can change this using `pi`:
`A <pi> B C` = `A [of] (B of C)`

## `la`

`A la B` = `when A happens, B happens` OR `if A, B`

can also be used to put adverbs:

`[adv] la [sentence]`

`ken la` = maybe

## time

`tempo [time] la [sentence]`

where `time`:

- ni: now
- kana: later, future
- pini: earlier, past

`tempo ni la mi ken toki e toki pona lili` = now i can speak a bit of toki pona

## compound sentences

objects can be stacked: `mi moku e kala e kili`
verbs too: `pipi li lape li moku`

## exercises

- `big place`: ma suli
- `good big place`: ma suli pona
- `loud` = big noise = kalama suli
- `mi tawa` = me + go = bye!

- `mi ken lape` = I _can_ sleep
- `ken la mi lape` = I might [be] sleep[ing]
- `maybe i can sleep` = ken la mi ken lape

### `mama sina li lawa e kulupu lipu suli`
